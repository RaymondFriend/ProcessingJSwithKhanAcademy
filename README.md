Processing JS with Khan Academy
============

Khan Academy offers a free platform for burgeoning programmers to create and share visual projects using [ProcessingJS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/advanced-development-tools/a/using-processingjs-outside-khan-academy). 

The directory `skeletons` presents a skeleton into which one could insert KA code to display on a stand-alone HTML file. I have written a few "packages" suitable for 3D display and interactivity using the `PVector` class. The other directory `projects` houses highlighted examples of my Khan Academy creations (hosted offline). You can check out my KA profile at [this hyperlink](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/rayjfriend/projects). 

*Sidenote*: at least one of my programs is [featured](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/programming-buttons/a/what-are-buttons) on the official Khan Academy curriculum! (Look for 3D Roller Coaster.)
